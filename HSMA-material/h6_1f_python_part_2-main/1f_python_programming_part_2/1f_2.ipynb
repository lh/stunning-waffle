You should be completing this when prompted by the trainer as Exercise 2 of the session.  You should read each task, and then try to write code to achieve what you are being asked in the code cell below each set of instructions.  Remember - check your code is working by running the code cell (CTRL + Enter whilst in the cell, or click the play button to the left of the cell)."

    "**Task 1** Write code that asks the user to input their age and stores the input as an integer.  If anything goes wrong with this, a message should be printed and the user should be asked again.  If (and only if) a valid input is obtained, the user should be informed how old they will be at their next birthday.  Regardless of whether the user input something valid or not, a message should be printed saying what a great little app this is.  If a valid input was entered, the program will then terminate, but if there was no valid input, the user will be asked again (and continued to be asked until a valid input is provided).  You should use an exception handling framework for this task."
