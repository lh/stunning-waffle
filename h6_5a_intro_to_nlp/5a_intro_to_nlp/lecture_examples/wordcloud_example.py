# STOPWORDS has a list of common stopwords (words such as "the", "and",
# "because", "isn't" etc that we're probably not interested in here).  We'll
# take a copy of STOPWORDS (which we'll call stopwords) in case we want to
# add our own etc.  We won't here, but we need them to remain as a set.
# Note - we're just setting up the set of stopwords here, we're not removing
# them from our text yet.  If we want to look at the stopwords, just type
# stopwords in the console after we've run this line of code.
stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)

# Tokenize the text (split into individual words (with punctuation attached) and
# put them in a list - we can see this if we look at the tokens list after we 
# run this)
tokens = full_text.split()

# Set up a translation table that maps punctuation characters (stored in
# string.punctuation) to 'None'.  (We can see the list of punctuation characters
# stored in string if we type string.punctuation in the console).  This allows 
# us to get rid of punctuation characters (which you'll have seen were still in 
# the tokens).  The maketrans() method of a string object takes up to three 
# inputs (arguments).  If we supply three, then the characters passed in the 
# third argument are mapped to 'None' - ie it gets rid of them.  So we pass 
# three inputs here - the first two we just pass empty strings (so it doesn't do
# any translation with them), and then we pass string.punctuation (which 
# contains a list of punctuation characters) as the third input.  It will then 
# set up a translation table that we can use to remove punctuation from text.
punctuation_mapping_table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)

# The translate() function maps one set of characters to another.  Here, we
# use that to translate tokens with punctuation to ones without punctuation
# by using the mapping table we specified above.  We use a list comprehension
# here to give us a list of tokens that have had the translation applied from
# the list of tokens that haven't.  After we run this bit of code, we can look
# at the tokens_stripped_of_punctuation.

# Convert all tokens to lowercase (so we don't count capitalised words
# differently).  We can use the lower() method of a string object (each token is
# a string) to make the string lowercase.  Again we use a list comprehension
# here.  We can then look at lower_tokens to see all our tokens are now lower
# case.
lower_tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens_stripped_of_punctuation]

# We need to put everything back into a single string of text for the word
# cloud to be generated.  Here, we just use the join method of a string to join 
# our list of lower case, punctuation-removed words together with spaces, and 
# put them in a single string.  Specifically, we use a space character string,
# and call the join method on that string (to use this as the joiner).  We can
# see the joined string after we've run this code.
joined_string = (" ").join(lower_tokens)

# Generate a wordcloud - specify the size, background colour, and the minimum
# font size.  We also specify the set of stopwords we want excluded that we
# set up earlier.  Specify that the word cloud should be generated on our text
# string by passing that string into the generate method of WordCloud.  
# Note that the minimum font size specified will exclude words that would 
# appear smaller than this (as they are too uncommon).  So reducing minimum
# font size acts as a proxy filter where more uncommon words are allowed in to 
# the cloud.
