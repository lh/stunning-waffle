### Exercises

#### Exercises where each of you works on something but you discuss your progress / ask questions in your groups

where each of you works on something but you discuss your progress / ask questions in your groups

In these types of exercises :
You should first check as a group that everyone understands the exercise

Each of you should undertake the task

One of the group should share their screen as they undertake the task (we recommend alternating who this is between exercises / sessions)

When one of you is stuck, you should ask the group for help

If you’re all stuck on something, you should call for a trainer to come and help by posting on Slack in your Peer Support Group’s channel

We recommend people have their cameras on wherever possible for all exercises (though you may wish to mute during typing etc for this type of exercise)

#### Exercises where you work as a single group to tackle a problem

In these types of exercises :
You should first check as a group that everyone understands the exercise

One of the group should share their screen (we recommend alternating who this is between exercises / sessions) and will lead the group.  This person will also present to the class if your group is selected to report back after the exercise

Everyone in the group will feed in to the task whilst the person sharing their screen undertakes the task (building code / making notes / drawing a diagram / putting together slides - depending on the task)

If you’re all stuck on something, you should call for a trainer to come and help by posting on Slack in your Peer Support Group’s channel

We recommend people have their cameras on wherever possible for all exercises

At the end of the exercise, we recommend that the person sharing their screen shares the code / work / link to the work on the Peer Support Group’s channel on Slack so everyone has a copy.

#### Exercises where you have a group discussion

In these types of exercises :
You should first check as a group that everyone understands the exercise

One person should be nominated as “spokesperson” and should make notes on the discussion, ready to report back to the class if your group is selected

We recommend people have their cameras on wherever possible for all exercises

At the end of the exercise, we recommend that the person sharing their screen shares the notes on the Peer Support Group’s channel on Slack so everyone has a copy.

Any assessments are made as friendly as possible. Mainly popular culture with a sci-fi theme.
