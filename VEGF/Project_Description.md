# Modelling eye injection pathways

## Project Description:

This project aims to develop a comprehensive and flexible simulation model to optimise anti-VEGF treatment strategies in ophthalmology. The model will address the complex challenges in anti-VEGF treatments, including frequent injections, multiple treatment options, and diverse strategies, whilst considering the significant resource consumption and high costs associated with these treatments.

### Key features of the project include:

Dual modelling approach using Mesa (agent-based) and SimPy (process-based) frameworks to determine the most suitable platform.

Data collection from electronic patient records, published literature, and expert clinician input.

Modular design to accommodate various treatment strategies, drug efficacies, and clinic capacities.

Validation process comparing model outputs with real-world data and expert review.

User-friendly interface with interactive dashboards for stakeholders to explore different scenarios.

Analysis of clinical effectiveness, costs, and resource requirements for various treatment approaches.

Adaptability to incorporate new drugs and treatment paradigms as they emerge.

## Project Objectives:

The project aims to provide a tool for data-driven decision-making in ophthalmology clinic management, potentially improving patient outcomes whilst optimising resource use and costs.
