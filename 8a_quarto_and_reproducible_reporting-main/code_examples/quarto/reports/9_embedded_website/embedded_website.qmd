## An embedding example

In the example below, we embed a website directly in the Quarto document.

:::{.callout-warning}
Note that you will be unable to use the `embed-resources: true` option when embedding websites in this way.
:::

Here, we've embedded a HSMA site.

```{=html}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/training-type/health-service-modelling-associates-programme-hsma/" title="Embedded Website"></iframe>
```

````
```{{=html}}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/training-type/health-service-modelling-associates-programme-hsma/" title="Embedded Website"></iframe>
```
````

You can adjust the size of the embedded website by changing the 'width' and 'height' parameters in the iframe.

:::{.callout-tip}
Note that unlike `{python}` or `{r}` code blocks in Quarto, we've included a `=` sign - i.e. `{=html}`

This is necessary and not a typo!
:::

## Some websites don't work!

Some websites will not work when embedded and will display as a blank space in the VSCode preview, and will display an error message when opened in a browser window.


```{=html}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://sites.google.com/nihr.ac.uk/hsma/home" title="Embedded Website"></iframe>
```

````
```{{=html}}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://sites.google.com/nihr.ac.uk/hsma/home" title="Embedded Website"></iframe>
```
````

For example, here is the embedded website <https://sites.google.com/nihr.ac.uk/hsma/home> when opened in firefox.

## Apps on Streamlit Community Cloud

For Streamlit apps hosted on the community cloud, you will need to amend the web address slightly.

For example, the app <https://hsma-7c-ex3-solution.streamlit.app/>

would become <https://hsma-7c-ex3-solution.streamlit.app/?embed=true>

```{=html}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://hsma-7c-ex3-solution.streamlit.app/?embed=true" title="Embedded Website"></iframe>
```

````
```{{=html}}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://hsma-7c-ex3-solution.streamlit.app/?embed=true" title="Embedded Website"></iframe>
```
````

You can read more about embedding Streamlit community cloud apps [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/share-your-app/embed-your-app).

## Stlite apps hosted on github pages

st-lite apps hosted on Github pages can also be embedded. These do not need to be adjusted.

Note that they will not work on Firefox - however, stlite apps will work on Chrome, Edge, Safari, and likely more.

```{=html}
<iframe width="780" height="500" src="https://hsma-programme.github.io/Teaching_DES_Concepts_Streamlit/" title="Embedded Website"></iframe>
