# Morphology of Penguins of the Antarctic

![](lter_penguins.png)

Introducing a groundbreaking new dataset that promises to revolutionize our understanding of Antarctic penguin species: the Palmer Archipelago Penguin Morphology Dataset. For the first time, researchers have compiled comprehensive measurements of Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins, offering unprecedented insights into these charismatic birds of the Southern Ocean.

This novel collection, gathered over three years of meticulous fieldwork from 2007 to 2009, presents a treasure trove of information on penguin physical characteristics. Led by the esteemed Dr. Kristen Gorman and supported by the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, this dataset unveils precise measurements of bill dimensions, flipper lengths, and body masses across multiple islands in the Palmer Archipelago.

The full details of the penguin dataset can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

## Explore the Dataset

```{python}
#| label: full-dataframe-display
show(
    penguins_df,
    buttons=["copyHtml5", "csvHtml5", "excelHtml5"],
    )
```

```{python}

px.bar(
    penguins_df['species'].value_counts()
)

```

```{python}

px.bar(
    penguins_df['island'].value_counts()
)

```

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(penguins_df[['island', 'species']].value_counts())
```

```{python}

px.bar(
    penguins_df[['island', 'species']].value_counts().reset_index(),
    x='species',
    y='count',
    color='island'
)

```

## Insights into Penguin Morphology

The relationship between bill length and bill width in Antarctic penguins is an important aspect of their morphology that has been studied extensively. This relationship varies among different penguin species and can provide insights into their ecology and evolution.

```{python}
#| label: basic-bill-scatterplot
px.scatter(
    penguins_df,
    x="bill_length_mm",
    y="bill_depth_mm"
)
```

Chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarcticus) exhibit sexual dimorphism in their bill dimensions. Males generally have larger bills than females, with both bill length and bill depth being significantly different between the sexes[^1].

Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Bill-depth-and-bill-length-in-46-adult-chinstrap-penguins-A-and-bill-length-and-middle_fig2_273495548 [accessed 27 Sept 2024]

This dimorphism is consistent across different populations, with males having bills that are 5.4% to 11.5% larger than females on average[^2].

### By Sex

The relationship between bill length and bill depth in chinstrap penguins is not linear. A study of 46 adult chinstrap penguins revealed a distinct pattern when plotting bill depth against bill length[^1]. This relationship can be used to differentiate between males and females, as the two sexes tend to cluster separately when these measurements are compared.

```{python}
#| label: bill-scatterplot-chinstrap-sex

px.scatter(
    penguins_df[penguins_df["species"] == "Chinstrap"],
    x="bill_length_mm",
    y="bill_depth_mm",
    color="sex"
)
```

## Differences in Penguin Bill Measurement By Island

Site-specific differences in both bill length and bill depth have been observed across various islands[^1].

These variations suggest that environmental factors or genetic isolation may influence bill morphology in different populations.

### Biscoe

```{python}
#| label: bill-scatterplot-island-biscoe

px.scatter(
    penguins_df[penguins_df["island"] == "Biscoe"],
    x="bill_length_mm",
    y="bill_depth_mm",
    color="species"
)
```

### Dream

```{python}
#| label: bill-scatterplot-island-dream

px.scatter(
    penguins_df[penguins_df["island"] == "Dream"],
    x="bill_length_mm",
    y="bill_depth_mm",
    color="species"
)
```

### Torgersen

```{python}
#| label: bill-scatterplot-island-torgersen

px.scatter(
    penguins_df[penguins_df["island"] == "Torgersen"],
    x="bill_length_mm",
    y="bill_depth_mm",
    color="species"
)
```


## Morphology Summary

```{python}
penguin_summary_table_morphology = pd.DataFrame(
    penguins_df.groupby(['species', 'island']).mean(numeric_only=True)
    )

(
    GT(penguin_summary_table_morphology)
    .tab_header(title="Morphology of Penguins of the Palmer Archipelago",
                subtitle=f"{penguins_df['year'].min()} to {penguins_df['year'].max()}")
    .fmt_number(columns=["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g"],
                decimals=1)
    .cols_hide(columns="year")
    .cols_label(
        bill_length_mm="Bill Length (mm)",
        bill_depth_mm="Bill Depth (mm)",
        flipper_length_mm="Flipper Length (mm)",
        body_mass_g="Body Mass (g)"
    )
    )
