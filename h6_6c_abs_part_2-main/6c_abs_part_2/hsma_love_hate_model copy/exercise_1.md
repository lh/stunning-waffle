First, you should look back over the code and play around with the model’s interface to get a feel for how the model works
Then, your task as a group is to adapt the model as follows (you should take a copy of the two files first, so you’ve still got the original as a reference).  In the current model, there is only love and hate, nothing in between.  

I want you to adapt the model so that :
- Each HSMA has a love score instead, which represents how fond they are of HSMA.  It’s up to you how you implement this score.
- HSMAs who have stronger emotions (either love or hate) towards the course are more persuasive than those whose opinions are not as strong.  Again, it’s entirely up to you how you decide to implement this.
- Make the probability that a HSMA moves on any given time step a probability fed into the model, and which can be set by the user.
- Update both your visualisation of agents and your outcome metric(s) to better represent the new logic of your model.  How you do this is again up to you.


Run your new model and see what behaviours you notice emerging
If you do all of that, make some additional adaptations / extensions to the model of your choosing.

When we come back, we’ll ask each group to briefly present their adapted models, and Sammi will judge the top three for PSG Points!
