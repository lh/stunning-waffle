# HSMA Session 3B

## Learning Objectives

### Part 1: Advanced QGIS

Students should be able to:

- Identify common geographical data format (GeoJSON, GeoPackage, ESRI shapefiles) and explain the benefits of each
- Import different kinds of data (GeoJSON, GeoPackage, ESRI shapefiles)
- Create a choropleth from data stored within one of the above file formats
- Explain the different ways of categorising and colouring area data
- Change the colourschemes of choropleths
- Explain the importance of considering data standardisation
- Be able to join flat data without inherent geographic information within to shapefiles to create choropleths
- Generate a print layout

### Part 2: Mapping in Python

Students should be able to:

- Explain the benefits and downsides of creating maps in Python rather than in QGIS
- Explain the value and key features of the Geopandas package, and the kind of data it is used with
- Import a geo file (e.g. shapefile, geojson) using Geopandas
- Create a GeoDataFrame from a standard Pandas DataFrame that contains geographic data
- Join a GeoDataFrame to an existing Pandas dataframe
- Create a simple plot using the Geopandas plot method
- Plot point data and adjust point size, colour and opacity in static maps
- Plot choropleth data and adjust opacity, colourschemes and edge boundary colour
- Select small regions within a larger area
- Add a basemap to a static map
- Add labels to a static map
- Use libraries to improve the layout of labels
