# Two maps, one canvas
Easiest way to achieve is to insert a map with eg the first choropleth showing, twice. Right click on the first map, go to Item Properties|Layers and 
- [x] "Lock layers"

Then go back to the main map, change the visible choropleth to the one wanted for the second map, return to canvas, refresh. Lock the layer if you wish and print.
