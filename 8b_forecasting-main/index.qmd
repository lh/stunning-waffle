## Running the code

For all code-along notebooks and exercises, you have several options.

- Run it locally on your machine using the hsma_forecast environment
    - Note that due to some big packages, this may take longer than usual to install

- Run the exercises in colab using the buttons next to each exercise on this page

- Run the exercises in Github Codespaces, which will give you access to a virtual version of VSCode running in the cloud.
    - Click on 'Use this template' and 'Open in a codespace'

    - Initial setup may take ~5 minutes - when it is ready, you will see the contents of the repository on the left

    - When prompted within the environment to pick a kernel, choose 'Python environments' and 'Python 3.11.10'

    - If you need to return to the same codespace later, choose 'Code' and 'Codespaces', then click the codespace under 'on current branch'. Yours will have a different autogenerated name.

## Part 2 - Forecasting with the Prophet library

- Watch the recording of the lecture from last year.

:::{.callout-tip}
In the video, Elliott uses v1.0.0 of Prophet. The environment contains a newer version this year that should have Mac chip compatability

## Optional Bonus Reading and Videos

If you are interested in learning more about forecasting, here are some additional resources.

### Book - Forecasting: Principles and Practice

While this eBook is R-focussed, it's a great overview of various elements of forecasting.

<https://otexts.com/fpp3/>

There is a repository of Python equivalent code.

<https://github.com/zgana/fpp3-python-readalong>

### Videos - Advanced forecasting methods

These additional videos **are completely optional** and only recommended if this is an area you are extremely interested in - even then, Prophet may be sufficient for your use case, and you should be warned that the code used in these videos is complex!

#### Auto-regressive Forecasting using OLS

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftYxpwQGUz0 >}}

You can download the notebook here:
