    "# Creating synthetic Titanic passenger data with SMOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthetic data may be useful to share when it is not possible to share original data, or to augment data for a class of interest for which we do not have sufficient data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use original Titanic passenger data to create new synthetic passenger data. We then train a logistic regression model on that synthetic data and test on real data that was not used to create the synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of SMOTE\n",
    "\n",
    "SMOTE stands for Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique [1]. SMOTE is most commonly used to create additional data to enhance modelling fitting, especially when one or more classes have low prevalence in the data set. Hence the description of oversampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "SMOTE works by finding near-neighbor points in the original data, and creating new data points from interpolating between two near-neighbor points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we remove the real data used to create the synthetic data, leaving only the synthetic data. This is the process you would go through if you were looking to use synthetic data INSTEAD OF real data. After generating synthetic data we remove any data points that, by chance, are identical to original real data points, and also remove 10% of points that are closest to the original data points. We measure ‘closeness’ by the Cartesian distance between standardised data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/smote.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Demonstration of SMOTE method. (a) Data points with two features (shown on x and y axes) are represented. Points are colour-coded by class label. (b) A data point from a class is picked at random, shown by the black point, and then the closest neighbours of the same class are identified, as shown by yellow points. Here we show 3 closest neighbours, but the default in the SMOTE `Imbalanced-Learn` library is 6. One of those near-neighbour points is selected at random (shown by the dark brown point). A new data point, shown in red, is created at a random distance between the two selected data points.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling integer, binary, and categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard SMOTE method generates floating point (non-integer) values between data points. There are alternative ways of handing integer, binary, and categorical data using the SMOTE method. Here the methods we use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Integer* values: Round the resulting synthetic data point value to the closest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Binary*: Code the value as 0 or 1, and round the resulting synthetic data point value to the closest integer (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Categorical*: One-hot encode the categorical feature. Generate the synthetic data for each category value. Identify the category with the highest value and set to 1 while setting all others to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation with IMBLEARN\n",
    "\n",
    "Here use the implementation in the IMBLEARN IMBALANCED-LEARN [2] \n",
