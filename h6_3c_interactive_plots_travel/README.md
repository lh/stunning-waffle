# HSMA Session 3C

## Learning Objectives

### Part 1: Interactive Maps

Students should be able to:

- Create an interactive point map using Folium
- Create an interactive choropleth using Folium
- Add custom markers to Folium maps
- Change the basemap tiles in a Folium map
- Explain when to choose Folium vs Kepler for interactive maps

### Part 2: Working with Travel Times

Students should be able to:

- Use a pre-collected dataset of LSOA-LSOA centroid travel times to generate a choropleth
- Use the matrix method of the routingpy package to generate car and walking travel times from an open-source API for a given combination of sources and destinations
- Explain the benefits and downsides of using routingpy over directly interacting with different travel time APIs
- Show an awareness of the limitations of different travel time APIs
- Explain what an isochrone is
