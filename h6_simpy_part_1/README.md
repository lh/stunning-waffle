NOTE : in order to run the lecture examples and undertake the exercises in the DES sessions, you will need to use the des environment.

If you have already set this up as part of the final exercise in session 1D, you need do nothing other than activate the environment using :

`conda activate des`

or by selecting the des kernel from VSCode.

If you have not set up the environment as part of this earlier exercise, you will need to first import it from the supplied environment file.

Once you have downloaded the repository, navigate to the environment directory in your Ananconda prompt and type :

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

# Online alternative for exercise

Alternatively, you can undertake the exercise on **Google Colab**, a free online platform for coding exercises. You will need to be logged in to a google account in your browser. 

Using the links below will open a fresh copy of the notebook to work on - your changes will not be visible to anyone else. However, if you want to be able to refer back to your version of the notebook in future, make sure you click **'File --> Save to Drive'**. 
Your changes will then be saved to your own account, and you can access your edited copy of the notebook from https://colab.research.google.com/.
